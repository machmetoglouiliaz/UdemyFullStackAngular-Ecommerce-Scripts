## How to
- Download the scripts (you can click on them separately and from the menu right top side(3 dots), choose download)
- Run the scripts as shown in the course
- Put the images to the directory `./public/images/products` instead of `./src/assets/images/products`
- The app should be running now with images! (If you have any question, you can leave an issue on this repo at GitHub, I will return asap)
